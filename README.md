## Education
- Undergraduate at UT Austin (Electrical and Computer Engineering)
- Jordan High School (GPA 4.0/4,0 UW)

## Experiences
**NASA Summer Robotics Academy Intern**
- Worked with the Lunar Terrain Vehicle Ground Test Unit (LTV-GTU) team to repair steering/propulsion motors and a brake chip.
- Designed and began fabricating handles for an LTV-GTU mast.
- Collaborated with other interns to prototype a 2 DOF segment of a space manipulator.<br>

**FIRST Robotics Competition**
- Led control system design and integration for the team's robots (2023; 2024)
- Highlighted ease of maintenance and building a robust system, which led to little-to-no workmanship errors during competition seasons
- Grew the electrical team from two to six, expanding our project capacity
- Star Topology validation: a project to quantitatively determine the viability of using a star topology for the CAN bus. Collected and analyzed data from motor controller oscilloscope readings under various stub lengths/counts
- Assisted in subsystem conceptualization and low-fidelity prototyping
